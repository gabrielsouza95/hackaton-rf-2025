        <p>
          🌌 I am a very curious person and I love learning, as a good lifelong learner 🧑‍🔬.
          <br>
          In my projects, I seek to combine everything I enjoy doing, for example:
          <br>
          - programming embedded systems and distributed web applications.
          <br>
          - electronics and mechanical projects.
          <br>
          <br>
          I use my car as a study platform for my learning process in mechanics, performing its
          maintenance and enhancements.
          <br>
          <br>
          I really enjoy 3D printing and modeling. 
          I volunteer to maintain the 3D printers at <a href="https://www.bauru.unesp.br/#!/citeb/fab-lab/">FabLab Bauru</a>.

        <h2>👩🏽‍🚀 Projects 🤖</h2>

        <p>
          As my college thesis, a <a href="https://github.com/gabrielsouza95/CarManGUI">telemetry system for FEB Racing.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          I am doing 3D printing, learning everything from scratch, including printer maintenance, and I have already been able to print with ABS and PLA.
        </p>
    
        <h2>🏆 Accomplishments 🏅</h2>
    
        <p>
          I disassembled and assembled the engine of a Corsa Wind 8v 4-door hatchback without air conditioning or power steering with the help of many colleagues. It was incredible.
          In addition to this adventure, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/banguela_ocorsa/">I have done several other maintenance tasks</a> on it, and more are being done.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          I am doing maintenance on the printers at the <a href="https://www.bauru.unesp.br/#!/citeb/fab-lab/">FabLab of Unesp Bauru</a> and learning laser cutting with the people there.
